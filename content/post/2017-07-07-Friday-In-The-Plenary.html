<h2>R Consortium sponsor talk</h2>
<p>The R Consortium is a not-for-profit organisation which funds most of the key infrastructure for the R Project. Sponsors include IBM, Microsoft, Google, RStudio as well as several tech firms and data consultancies. They exist as a group of business enterprises interested in R thriving in the long-term. In essence a way for businesses who use R to contribute back. They see themselves as the link between the R Foundation, Industry and the R Community.</p>
<p>Turns out the R Consortium calls themselves “a Linux Foundation project”.</p>
<p>In terms of what the Consortium does:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one of the first projects of the Consortium was creating R-Hub to help developers and this is described as a major motivator for the consortium as a part of their future proofing efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>the Infrastructure Steering Committee headed by Hadley</p></li>
<li><p>working groups are set up for future proofs, a code coverage tool and certification</p></li>
<li><p>There is an annual R community survey!</p></li>
<li><p>Funding for what they also call “infrastructure” involving conferences and local useR groups which are all eligible for grants</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, David Smith, the Aussie at Microsoft, said some very nice things as a board member at the consortium (all of the major sponsors get a seat on the board). Microsoft sees a huge amount of value in the ecosystem of R. “Microsoft doesn’t do anything out of the goodness of their heart, if it has one.”</p>
<p>(My notes for this are combined with notes from a presentation on Wednesday called “How the R Consortium helps the R Community”)</p>

<h2>20 Years of CRAN</h2>
<p>Uwe Ligges has been the head of CRAN since 2003. He describes CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) simply as a standardised way of adding packages to software. This presentation involved a lot of love and patting each other on the back.</p>
<p>In 1997 CRAN was created for the R Project to mirror what was already in existence for Pearl (CPAN) and LaTeX (CTAN). There was much discussion later about how CRAN had become the most successful archive network there is. In 2007 <strong>S</strong>, as in the software <strong>R</strong> was based on, tried to introduce CSAN and went nowhere with it. David Smith described CRAN as the most important element of the success of R.</p>
<p>There was also some updates on the current state of CRAN. Currently there are <span class="math inline">\(2^{13}\)</span> packages on CRAN. He then listed the packages with the most dependencies on other packages with the clear <em>winner</em> being <code>knitr</code> with 2,161 (counting dependencies within dependencies).</p>
<p>A bit of practical advice was to test your package without RStudio or devtools before submitting and generally try to minimise the number of dependencies you need.. because packages can update and break things.</p>
<p>Now the question on a few people’s lips: what keeps CRAN free of malware?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>there are no guarantees.. this is the nature of opensource software</p></li>
<li><p>there are many sets of eyes on any package at any time. i.e. herd immunity</p></li>
<li><p>no binaries can be changed with any additional R package because all the binaries on CRAN were built on CRAN! Thus packages can only code what CRAN lets it CRAN code in the R software.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Below sums up the festivities:</p>

<p>Nick Teirney was called to the stage to amp up the crowd about useR!2018 in Brisbane. He kept on the beverages-as-an-incentive theme by describing the location as within 400m of about 50 bars, and rightly commenting on Australia’s premo coffee culture.</p>

<p>Many many many times throughout the conference people said something like “well it’s great the conference is so close for you next year!” I take 2 things from this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>this year was very very Euro focused and next year it will be interesting to see how many people from outside the Asia-Pacific make it over (it could be a bigger year for Asian useRs which would be cool!)</p></li>
<li><p>we should really have a crack at melding into the R community in Australia, starting with getting involved in MeetUps in Sydney, which will be a great way to gear up our skills.</p></li>
